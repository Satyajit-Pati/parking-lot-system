Smart Parking Lot System is a simple backend system built with Spring Boot, Java 17, and JPA/Hibernate, designed to manage parking lots with multiple floors and spot types (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE). It supports core operations like vehicle entry/exit, spot assignment, and fee calculation. On startup, it automatically initializes a sample parking lot with floors and predefined spots using DataInitializer. The project follows a clean folder structure with entities, services, repositories, and controllers. Perfect for beginners learning backend development, relational mapping, and RESTful API design.
